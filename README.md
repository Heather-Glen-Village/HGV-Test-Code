# HGV-Test-Code
A Collection of Code for testing sensors and other System. Each ino file should be a 100% working code that is used to debug any hardware issues or to test system before Implementing them fully. 

## Arduino
Here you can find code to test the Arduino to test if they are working such as Ethernet, Modbus, MQTT, and RS485.
## Python
Here are some more test for the project that are made with Python. Most of this code is used for the Website to make sure it can take in data.

## Contributing
I would Recommend when testing a new hardware part and you finsh the working code, upload it to this Repository so other people are able to test the code working.
